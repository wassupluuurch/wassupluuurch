- 👋 Hi, I’m @wassupluuurch, the homies call me Lurch but my name is Tyler but I honestly & truly prefer Lurch. 
- 👀 I’m interested in everything bruh. Like, literally. I don't know shit about shit but I wanna learn as much as I possibly can about anything and everything, and, frankly, I need all the damn help I can get. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too damn slow for my own good. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on you don't want me collaborating on anything, unless it's something you want to sabotage. I have a remarkable ability to inadvertently fuck shit up in unforeseeable, usually pretty ridiculous and almost farcical ways. So, sabotage, being dead weight, making everyone else look masterful, these are really the only areas in which I can contribute... for now at least.  
- 📫 How to reach me I might be dumb & naive but I'm not THAT stupid. Yall gonna have to work a lil harder to get my contact info, nice try tho fuckers, I respect the hustle.
